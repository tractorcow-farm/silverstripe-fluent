# Using DataObjects with Fluent

## CMS Fields

With each of the possible extensions that come with Fluent, it's necessary to configure your DataObjects to
correctly delegate your `$fields` to extensions. A different approach may be needed for each DataObject, depending
on how it generates it's fields.

In all cases, it is necessary to ensure that the `updateCMSFields` extension method is called once (and
only once) on each `FieldList` object.

### Default field scaffolder

If using a default field scaffolder (such as `SiteTree::getCMSFields` or `DataObject::getCMSFields`)
it is necessary to know that these methods both, by default, will call the
`extend('updateCMSFields', $fields)` extension before returning.

If you wish to add any translated form fields to the result of this call, then you should use `beforeUpdateCMSFields`

```php

class MyPage extends SiteTree
{
	public function getCMSFields()
    {
		// Adding the Description field early will allow FluentField to decorate this with the appropriate
		// CSS classes.
		$this->beforeUpdateCMSFields(function($fields) {
			$fields->addFieldToTab('Root.Main', new TextField('Description'));
		});

		// The result of this call will have had beforeUpdateCMSFields then updateCMSFields called on it
		$fields = parent::getCMSFields();
		$fields->removeByName('Content', true);
		return $fields;
	}
}

```

### Explicit field generation

If explicitly generating your `FieldList`, simply make sure to call the appropriate extension hook prior to returning.

```php

class MyObject extends DataObject
{
	public function getCMSFields()
    {
		// Note the absence of any parent::getCMSFields
		$fields = new FieldList(
			new TextField('Title', 'Title', null, 255),
			new TextareaField('Description')
		);

		// This line is necessary, and only AFTER you have added your fields
		$this->extend('updateCMSFields', $fields);
		return $fields;
	}
}

```

### Extensions

As mentioned in the CMS Fields heading, it is necessary to ensure that the `updateCMSFields` extension method is called
once (and only once) on each `FieldList` object. Fields added by other extensions will not have the necessary
decorations applied to it by the `FluentExtension`, unless it happens to be applied before `FluentExtension`. Since
extension order cannot be guaranteed, this poses a problem.

You can circumvent this issue by extending `FluentExtension` from your custom extension and then calling
`parent::updateCMSFields($fields)` at the end of your method. This way it is actually one call to `updateCMSFields`
using inheritance rather than two different extensions:

```php
use TractorCow\Fluent\Extension\FluentExtension;

class PlayerExtension extends FluentExtension
{
    public function updateCMSFields(FieldList $fields)
    {
        $fields->removeByName('SomeIrrelevantField');
        parent::updateCMSFields($fields);
    }
}
```

#### Versioned extension

**Important:** If you're applying the `FluentVersionedExtension` to a versioned DataObject, you will need to ensure that
it is applied _after_ the `Versioned` extension. You can control this with an `after: '#versionedfiles'` rule in your
YAML title block. An example configuration block might look like this:

```yaml
---
Name: mysitefluent
After: '#versionedfiles'
---
SilverStripe\Assets\File:
  extensions:
    - TractorCow\Fluent\Extension\FluentVersionedExtension
  translate:
    - Title
```

### Fluent `has_one`s

By default when you specify a related field to be `fluent`ed the same ID is used for both versions this can cause problems where you update the object and it is updated for all languages. To get around this you can use the `TractorCow\Fluent\Extension\FluentBlackListFields` Extension to specify explicit fields to not copy the value of when creating the new translation.
An example configuration where you want separate MessageObjects for different languages may look like this:

```php
class MyObject extends DataObject
{
    private static $has_one = [
        'Message' => 'MessageObject'
    ];

    private static $extensions = [
        'TractorCow\Fluent\Extension\FluentBlackListFields("MessageID")',
    ];
}
```
